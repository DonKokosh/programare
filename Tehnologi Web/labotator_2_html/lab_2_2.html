    <h1>A Simple Sample Web Page</h1>
    <h2>Demonstrating a few HTML features</h2>
    HTML is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with commands that are enclosed by "&lt;" and "&gt;" characters, or bewteen an "&amp;" and a ";".
    <h3>Line Breaks</h3>
    HTML doesn 't normally use line breaks for ordinary text. A white space of any size is treated as a single space. This is because the author of the page has no way of knowing the size of the reader's screen, or what size type they will have their browser
    set for.
    <h4>Starting and Stopping Commands</h4>
    Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example, "&lt;H4&gt;" marks the beginning of a size 4 heading, and "&lt;/H4&gt;" marks the end of it. The closing command is always the same as the opening command, except for the addition of the "/".
    <h1>This is a size "1" heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a size "2" heading</h2>
    <h3>This is a size "3" heading</h3>
    <h4>This is a size "4" heading</h4>
    <h5>This is a size "5" heading</h5>
    <h6>This is a size "6" heading</h6>
    <a href="#top">TOP</a>
